NearSat - Simple program to show you the closest satellite to your position. 

It uses current TLE data from the official <a href="https://celestrak.com/">Celestrak</a> website and the <a href="https://github.com/1manprojects/one_Sgp4">One_SGP4</a> library to calculate the positions of the satellites.

It is nowhere near done, as I have exams in the next few weeks, but over the summer I want to possibly expand this program to be able to select which satellite you are tracking, and possibly even build a robotic arrow to point towards the satellite in the sky.
